## 1: Extreme Programming Framework .(my article on medium)
The key Rules of Extreme Programming (XP):

### Planning
Planning be done incrementally, and that plans should be revised frequently as new information becomes available.

### Small releases
Software releases be kept small and frequent, allowing for feedback and adjustment.

### Metaphor
A common metaphor to help team members communicate and understand the software being developed.

### Simple design
Software be designed in the simplest way possible, while still meeting customer requirements.

### Refactoring
XP recommends that code be refactored (i.e., improved without changing its external behavior) regularly to maintain its quality.

### Pair programming
Developers work in pairs, with one developer writing code and the other reviewing it.

### Collective ownership
All code be owned by the entire development team, rather than by individual developers.

### Continuous integration
XP recommends that code changes be integrated into a shared codebase as frequently as possible to detect integration issues early.

### 40-hour workweek
Team members work no more than 40 hours per week to avoid burnout and maintain productivity.

### On-site customer
XP recommends having a customer representative work directly with the development team to provide feedback and clarify requirements.

### Coding standards
Team agrees on coding standards to ensure consistency and maintainability of the codebase.

### Open workspace
Open workspace to promote communication and collaboration within the development team.

### Sustainable pace
Team work at a sustainable pace, avoiding the “heroic” effort and long hours often associated with software development.

### Listening
Team members actively listen to each other, seeking to understand each other’s perspectives and concerns.

### Testing
Automated testing be used extensively to ensure software quality and detect errors early.

### 2: Pair Programming and its Benefits.
This practice requires two programmers to work jointly on the same code. While the first developer focuses on writing, the other one reviews code, suggests improvements, and fixes mistakes along the way. Such teamwork results in high-quality software and faster knowledge sharing but takes about 15 percent more time. In this regard, it’s more reasonable trying pair programming for long-term projects.

### 3: Git Repository Guidelines in Agile Development.
1. Start thinking about tasks as Git branches
2. Committing small changes frequently
3. Keep branches short-lived(If you have a long running feature branch remember that you effectively have two divergent versions of your code base, which will result is more bug fixes and conflicts).
4. Multiple branches are individually testable, so take advantage.


### 4: Benefits of working in Batches in Agile.
Working in small batches has many benefits like:

1. It reduces the time it takes to get feedback on changes, making it easier to triage and remediate problems.
2. It increases efficiency and motivation.
3. It prevents your organization from succumbing to the sunk-cost fallacy.

### 5: What Exactly is MVP? (Minimum Viable Product).
“The minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.”

A minimum viable product helps product managers begin the process of learning quickly. It’s the fastest way to get through the validated learning loop (Build-Measure-Learn) with the minimum amount of effort and risk.

**MVP = Low / medium risk or effort with Medium / high ROI(return-on-investment)**

### 6: Get a Good Basic Understanding of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD); and difference between them.

### 7: Why is TDD Important for DevOps?
TDD process itself forces us to take only small steps forward, which is key to the success of a DevOps implementation, as we saw in the blog post on using small batches.

Therefore, using TDD helps us significantly in our task of implementing a DevOps model.
