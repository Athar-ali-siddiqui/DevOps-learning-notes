### DevOps Behaviors:
DevOps is not only about tools, but also about a cultural shift in the organization. DevOps culture involves collaboration, transparency, continuous feedback, automation, and a focus on customer needs. Read more at: https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using machine-readable definition files rather than manually configuring infrastructure components. IaC benefits include reproducibility, scalability, and reduced errors. Read more at: https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code

### Continuous Integration (CI):
CI is a software development practice where team members frequently integrate their code changes into a central repository. This allows for early detection and resolution of integration issues, faster feedback cycles, and higher code quality.

### Continuous Delivery (CD):
CD is the practice of automating the entire software delivery process, from code changes to production deployment. It aims to reduce lead times, improve code quality, and increase the frequency of releases. Read more at: https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/continuous-delivery

### DevOps vs Site Reliability Engineering (SRE):
DevOps and SRE are similar in their focus on collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement. However, SRE places more emphasis on reliability, availability, and resilience of systems. Read more at: https://devops.com/devops-vs-sre-whats-the-difference/

### Organizational Impact of DevOps:
DevOps requires changes to organizational structure, processes, and culture. It promotes cross-functional teams, shared responsibility, and a focus on end-to-end delivery. Read more at: https://enterprisersproject.com/what-is-devops

### Cloud Computing:
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, such as storage, processing power, and applications, on a pay-as-you-go basis. It provides flexibility, scalability, and cost savings for organizations. Read more at: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/

### Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing:
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) identifies five essential characteristics of cloud computing: on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.

### Cloud Deployment Models:
Cloud deployment models include public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, and multi-cloud. Public cloud services are hosted by a third-party provider and available to anyone over the internet. Private cloud services are dedicated to a single organization and hosted either on-premises or by a third-party provider. Hybrid cloud is a combination of public and private cloud, and multi-cloud involves using multiple cloud providers. Read more at: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/

### Cloud Service Models and Their Benefits:
Cloud service models include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides virtualized computing resources, PaaS provides a platform for developing and deploying applications, and SaaS provides software applications over the internet. Benefits of cloud service models include scalability, cost savings, and increased agility. Read more at: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/
